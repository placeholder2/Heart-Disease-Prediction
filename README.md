## **Goal of this project**

The goal of this project was to get experience with imbalanced datasets and get proficiency in using tools from imbalanced-learn  and XGBoost.

## **Data**

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease). 


## **Project structure**
This project is split in four notebooks:

**Exploratory Data Analysis I**\
General Info and Univariate Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis II**\
Bivariate analysis

**Feature Engineering**\
Modifying data based on findings in previous notebook.

**Prediction**\
Building classification model Using XGBoost and over-sampling techniques.
